As i couldn't get the makefile to to generate the plots working correctly my goal is to improve the file export and add an plot function with matplotlib


two example measurements could be found in the Measurement folder. 

The best option currently is to run it with the -k option, thats the one i develop curently. 

It's possible to save the measured data as pickle to restore and plot them later. Furthermore a small measurement protocol is saved with the results.


# ToDo  
- Save measuremnts and plot data in human readable format
